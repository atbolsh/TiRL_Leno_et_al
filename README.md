This project was built on Python 2.7. Standard Python should be enough to execute the experiments, the graph generation code was originally published at https://github.com/f-leno/AdHoc_AAMAS-17 and for that you will need to install Jupyter Notebook (http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

# Files
The folder <b>prey-predator</b> contains all the Python source files.

The folders <b>log</b> and <b>qtables</b> contain pre-executed experiments that were used in the paper

# How to use

The folder <b>code</b> stores all implementations. The <b>expScript.py</b> file executes all the experiments.

Executing again all experiments will take a long time. To print again all the graphs using the pre-generated result files, execute the file <b>evaluation-leno.ipynb</b> using jupyter notebook.
